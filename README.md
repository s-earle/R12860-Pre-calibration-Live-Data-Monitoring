# R12860-Pre-calibration-Live-Data-Monitoring
GUI that shows current data quality

Test_v1 is the first attempts made to the GUI. The system workflow will need to "live" monitor the data aqcuisition. 

The main idea of the workflow will be: //
  -> Take small subset of most recent scanning point //
  -> Process that data to a useful metric -- A measure of data quality -- or even just something simple but understandable to a non-expert
  -> Output results in a GUI on screen -- merged with Han's GUI.
