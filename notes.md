# Working notes

2026016: Currently the GUI is operating at a shortened timeframe which is likely producing bugs when it executes server commands and server sync. 

## Future Tasks:
As of 20260116:
1. ~~Need a reference histogram - this will probably be good to source from the reference PMT, as well as a good histogram ~~
2. ~~Having error bars will also be good so the shifter understands if the system is within operating range ~~
3. A check for darkness - measure the rates - maybe the pedestal ?
4. How can we use this for cross calibration?
5. Can we use this for a High Voltage scan? 
6. Need to implement a if crash - kill server jobs
7. With reference sensors, can/how use SiPM?
8. Reference sensors may be different tabs on LHS
